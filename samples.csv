"Is it illegal to drink soda on the subway? Today on the L platform, a cop ticketed me for having an open container while I was drinking a sprite lmao. I asked him if it was illegal to drink soda and he said that any open container is illegal even if its soda. On my ticket, he conveniently wrote I was drinking alcohol, even after telling me the ticket was for an open container and that it didn’t matter if it was soda or alcohol. The whole thing smelt piggish. Should I contest in court or is there actually a law against carrying open sodas on the subway platform? Also, should I do anything with the fact that the cop lied on my ticket? I recorded the whole thing and can show footage of him not seeing me drink any alcohol while ticketing me for drinking alcohol (after telling me it was for soda).

"Documented cases of health issues from GP residents? I’m wondering if anyone here has (or knows anyone who has) documented proof that living in Greenpoint has negatively impacted their health. The Meeker Ave Plume Superfund site is a serious health issue which landlords seem to not be taking seriously. There is enough evidence of toxic chemical vapors affecting both indoor and outdoor air quality for the EPA to address it, and yet landlords don’t want testing done in fears of losing property value. Let me just say, I am a homeowner in Greenpoint. This issue would also affect MY property value. But this is bigger than a real estate investment. We’re talking about our health and the health of our community. It’s unacceptable that as of this year, only 200 properties have agreed to testing out of the 1,000 potentially affected. Recently saw North Brooklyn Neighbors & NYU did a new survey of residents living nearby the NuHart Superfund site on Dupont. There they didn’t find any strong links between proximity to the site and specific health issues, but the sample size was very small:","As a long time North Brooklyn resident, every time I bring this topic up to younger residents or residents new to the area, no one has any idea what I’m talking about, which I find concerning. I’m glad you’re bringing it up. I do believe the difference in impact from the Meeker plume/oil spill would be on proximity to the ground though. If you live on the 3rd floor, I think it’s very different than living on the ground floor or a basement apartment. Additionally, if you spent a lot of time as a little kid playing in or digging in the soil in Greenpoint (in a backyard let’s say) I think exposure could be significantly elevated. It was always a dream of mine to own a home up in Greenpoint as I think it’s a beautiful area and community. But the pollution east of McGuiness is a serious serious issue that is being swept under the rug and becoming forgotten to history, even though it’s still active. I believe Vice did a piece on this issue over a decade ago, interviewing local residents who said cancer rates were higher. But it was often with residents who grew up there before the plume was even known to exist (I think they only found it in the 70s right?). I live down in eastern Williamsburg (and have for over 1/3 of my life) and I’ve had similar concerns about my health living down here long term primarily due to air quality and proximity to Newtown Creek."

Worth it? I'm from Mesa we moved out to the Midwest 20 years ago and I've been considering about coming back but I've been told to stay away from Mesa so Gilbert worth the move?,"We love Gilbert. It feels the safest out of any area I’ve lived as an adult. We live more toward south east Gilbert and really close to *east* east Mesa, past Power Road (and Eastmark). Those are nice areas. We looked high and low at surrounding areas before we bought a house and can agree that below the 60 is a safe bet. However, people do seem to like Superstition Springs area. I go to a church right by there so I drive around in that area and it seems nice enough. Mesa in general does seem to have a dustier vibe than Gilbert overall."

"Accountant Rex to help set up LLC / S-Corp Hello! I recently became self employed full time - I’m working for a single company (client) via a consulting arrangement. Therefore, I am considering setting up an LLC and/or taxing as an S-Corp. Does anyone have any recommendations for a local cpa who is credible and can help me assess the pros/cons of creating an S-Corp? Some answers to presumptive questions: 1. I believe that I make enough income to make this worthwhile ($150K+) 2. I am generally financially savvy and am not looking for a full service financial advisor, but someone reasonably priced (I’ve only ever filed my own taxes using TurboTax) 3. I’m not considering purchasing a home within the next couple of years (from what I’ve read, declaring lower income via reasonable salary via S-Corp taxation can impact my income for mortgage qualification purposes. Thank you!","Hey there – I’m an accountant that works with small businesses, specifically solo S-Corps. I do a free S-Corp evaluation to help assess whether an S-Corp would make sense for you. Two important things covered in the eval are: (1) the comparative tax savings (net of additional costs) in S-Corp vs sole prop/LLC – this is a line-by-line 2025 tax return comparison that accounts for filing status, reasonable comp, fringe benefits, adjustments to income, standard deduction or itemized deductions, etc and (2) a reasonable salary calculation based on 31-inputs based on IRS guidance and data. Now for your questions (and two other considerations): 1. You’re in the proper income range ($100K+) to consider an S-Corp. The eval would further answer this question. 2. The tax comparison will show you the tax savings net of additional costs to run an S-Corp. 3. This can be true due to the standard process of many lenders to prioritize Sch C income and W-2 income, not K-1. However, I work with my clients’ lenders to help them understand this in a ‘letter of explanation.’ I have a guide I wrote specifically on this that I can share with you. 4. If your business is based in Park Slope, you’ll want to consider General Corporation Tax (GCT), which can offset some of tax advantages of an S-Corp. I can cover that in the eval. 5. It’s important to understand how going the S-Corp route can lower social security wages and therefore future SS benefits. I offer an all-in S-Corp service that includes payroll, personal and business taxes, reasonable comp calc, tax strategies, and monthly or quarterly check-ins. Happy to chat if you’re interested."

"Seeking info: Late night / early morning rides on NYE from Mooney’s Hi all, throwaway account for obvious reasons. On NYE I got irresponsibility intoxicated at Mooney’s and was understandably asked to leave. I did call and apologize to the bar tender who dealt with me that evening. In any case, I am trying to retrace my steps from there and offer thanks to the kind citizens who were looking out for me. I know from phone records that I left the bar headed for my hotel in uptown. Then my phone died around 1:30 or 2am. I woke up in a random home somewhere in that general vicinity, leading me to believe a Good Samaritan may have picked me up and let me sleep it off in their home. It felt like it could have been miles from Mooney’s, but I can’t be sure. I woke up in a panic and hurried out in shame so I did not get an address or any way to follow up. Another very kind soul then picked me up and took me up to Uptown where I finally completely my walk in the early AM (this might have been 5am). Any of this sound familiar to anyone one here? I’d love to connect (anonymously or not) with the people who took care of me to offer my gratitude and get some peace of mind about a scary situation I should not have put myself in. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. Please be gentle with any judgment, I know how absurd this situation may sound. EDIT: Based on further research I would almost certainly have been picked up around 2am on Schnebly Hill road. I suppose there is some chance I let myself into a random home in this area rather than being picked up, in which case I owe another major apology. This may be the same road I was then picked at 5am but it is hard to be certain— the house I woke up in could have been in another part of town. Thanks for any and all replies, including the kind first response below. Really trying to gain some peace of mind around what happened.",Alcohol’s a helluva drug.

I was thinking about locking the bike up right outside with a heavy-duty lock. I’ve noticed a few people around the neighborhood doing the same with bikes and electric scooters. Would it generally be okay to leave it outside like that, or is it likely to get stolen pretty quickly? For what it’s worth, I’d have full view of the bike from my window at all times.

"Assaulted in subway, unfortunate lessons learned Was commenting on another post of someone getting mugged, and thought it would be easier to put all the details here. I'll try to format it to go through everything and answer questions I anticipate. ## What happened? ## of incident June 12th, 1:08pm I walked down the Lafayette Ave C train entrance in Fort Greene on my way back to work. Station was quiet, no one was walking around. I went and paid the fare to the Manhattan bound side, walked down the stairs. The guy who would end up attacking me was sitting towards the bottom of the stairs, I didn't think anything of it and walked by him. Kept going and sat on the bench as the train was supposed to come by later, but I forgot exactly when at the time. Was looking on my phone, saw it would arrive at 1:22pm, so I just was reading some things online for work stuff. Meanwhile, the guy was yelling, and of course I ignored it because why would I want to get involved with that? Turned out he was yelling and insulting me in the most furious way, but I can't remember specifically what he said only the fact that he was extremely pissed off. About 2 or 3 minutes of sitting on the bench, I hear him run up to me, I look up only to catch him a second before he started punching me square in the face. Not once, but over and over. I put my arms in front of my face, not sure what the hell was happening, as he continued to yell at me. Only thing I remember was him saying that he wasn't gay, or accusing me of being gay. I don't remember the specifics at this point. I tried to stand up and get out of the way after being punched 4 or 5 times, to which he then punches me in the chest and then kicks me. Thankfully after this point he stops, and walks away after another person walks down the stairs. The attacker then starts talking to the new guy and mentions in a completely calm manner that the attacker things the new guy has a ""good aura about him"". All I could think of as to why is that both the attacker and the new guy are black, and I'm white, or that the new guy is just much taller than both me and the attacker with a bigger build. Who the fuck knows. The attacker then walks past the stairs, to the other side of the platform. Right before the guy left, I had a thought of taking a picture of the guy, but I didn't want to make it super obvious I was taking a picture of him out of fear of getting attacked again. Plus with my hands slightly shaking, I didn't get a picture of him and the camera was the front facing instead of rear facing. At this point I try to assess damages, adrenaline is rushing so I don't feel a ton of pain. My nose was bleeding, but I've had so many nose bleeds due to dry environments that it isn't that much of a big deal to me. Bleeding stops, then notice there's still blood on my hands from a cut on the top of the bridge of my nose. Took me a few seconds to commit to contacting the police, which thankfully can be reached over text. Again I was worried the guy would hear me call the police, and was trying to be as discrete as possible. I had not moved from that spot where he stopped hitting me, and didn't think I should move anywhere, in cause the attacker was walking around other parts of the station. The only jovial thing about all of this was the 911 dispatcher couldn't find the station, and I mentioned that it was next to the slutty vegan restaurant. Kinda hard to mistake it then. More people come down just stare at me, no one bothered to ask if I was ok or needed help. Just looked at me if I was an alien. 1:22 train came and past, cops arrived a few minutes after then. They asked for descriptions of the guy, etc and called for EMS. About 9 cops showed up in the end, just repeated the story. They mentioned to me that that station is one of the safer ones, which is also terrifying. I know people said that the subways were getting bad, but didn't think like this. The MTA worker told one of the cops when I was waiting for the EMS workers to arrive, that there was someone harassing people the day prior as well. Could have been the same person, but he wasn't sure. EMS finally arrived around 2pm, they didn't realize the dried blood on my nose weren't cuts, but they put some bandaids on me and an ice pack. Asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, but as I was holding my nose when I stopped the nose bleed and didn't feel it move or be extremely painful, I was only concerned with if I needed stitches. Was told no, so I just asked the cops if they could drive me to work as I would have a long train ride home and it would be easier to get my mind off of the events. ### Following days I was contacted by a detective for the case the next day, which also happened to be my birthday (great present, right?). Reiterated details, and was told there are security cameras and they would be able to pull footage from that time. Thankfully taking the picture gives me a very close time stamp to when it happened. That same day as I was going to do something for my birthday with people from work, I thought I saw the attacker walking down the street, as it was the same exact outfit that I remember. I understand that it is next to impossible to remember a lot and eye witnesses often can't recall correct information so I was a little skeptical and sat on it for 15 min. It bothered me enough that I gave a tip to the detective that I thought I saw the guy, walking towards the same station where it happened and to let the MTA worker know if that same person is there again harassing people. If he did it 2 days in a row, what's to say he wouldn't do it a third day? I didn't get a confirmation about if they did anything, only acknowledgement. Then on that Thursday, I was sent some video of the subway from an hour before, until the incident. I couldn't make out faces, and was a little hard to confirm. Then I was sent some pictures, with the detective asking me if I was the person in them, which I was. He told me that they have the entire thing on camera, and that yes the attacker came at me unprovoked and then left. No audio as far as I'm aware, but they didn't share that with me. Immediately afterwards I was told that they have the guy in custody and will make an arrest on that Friday. Apparently he had assaulted 4 other people, but no one made police reports so nothing could be done. I was told I would hear further, but have not as of today. ## Possible comments/questions ### ""if you had a self defense weapon, you would be ok right now"" No, the only way I would have been able to use something like mace or pepper spray, or hell, a knife or gun, is if I had it in my hands pointed in his direction the entire time I was in the subway. It's impractical. Yes if I was paying attention more it would have bought me maybe another 3 or 4 seconds, but without practice, it would have been useless. ### ""I would have fought back, you shouldn't have just stood there"" Calling bullshit on this as well, since unless you have self defense dialed in and it's entirely reflexes, you wouldn't have done shit. I had no reason to believe the guy was yelling at me, and would attack me. ### ""Did he try and take anything?"" No, and I'm fairly certain I had my phone in my hand the entire time. I don't recall putting it away and my memory is fuzzy if I took it out of my pocket or put it in my pocket when trying to attend to my nose bleed. ### ""Are you planning on using that subway/that station again?"" I don't think I'll be using the subway for a while. Given all the random shit happening, walking or taking a bicycle seem like better options. Especially as they tend to be a little faster for where I need to go. ### ""Are you ok?"" I had CT scans of my head and chest on Friday as I was feeling more pain in my chest. No broken bones just bruised ribs and some bruises on my face. Nothing too severe, and mostly healing fine. ### ""Is there something you would have done different if you knew it would have happened?"" Assuming I had to still go on the subway, probably not sitting on the bench (I feel like he only started yelling after I sat down), and not looking on my phone. Also seeing the guy on the stairs, I probably would have waited for someone else to walk down to not have to be the only person near him. Would that have prevented anything? I have no clue. I don't know if things would have turned out differently. Can only speculate. ### ""Was the attacker mentally ill?"" Almost certainly, I seem to recall him telling the first guy who walked down the stairs that he was fucked in the head. ### ""Was the attacker homeless?"" It didn't appear like he was, but I cannot confirm. ## Takeaways If anything, these are some points that I feel like are good to highlight - Yes, you can text 911 instead of calling. It can be life saving, please use it. - Filing a police report is important, especially if there's violence involved. They may not get the person now, but it builds a case against them. Or in my case, possibly prevent them from hurting other people in the future - Ignoring the yelling and other bs people do in the subway or on the street isn't enough. I always thought if I ignored it, I wouldn't be a part of whatever is going on. Clearly not the case. Keep your wits about you and watch for shady characters. - Time of day isn't the end all be all for safety - Check the train times for delays and whatnot before you get into the subway. Don't bother looking at your phone afterwards. It will obstruct your focus - Don't go into subway stations alone - People won't help you. I was always under the impression that new yorkers keep to themselves but will try to help in emergencies, but that's apparently bullshit. Help yourself if at all possible. See previous point - Call 911 or try to help people if you see them fucking bleeding in the subway, damn it. To be fair I don't know if anyone did call or text them who arrived, but is it really a big deal to just ask if someone is ok? I get not wanting to get involved, but seriously. We all should be better than that. - Attackers dont have to be rational. Trying to think of ways to protect yourself by only thinking of rational situations does not prepare you for random acts of violence.","So sorry this happened to you OP. Wanted to offer an alternative perspective on why no one said anything to you or asked if you were ok: as a woman, if I saw a bloody man sitting on a bench in the subway, there is no way for me to know if he was a victim or an aggressor. If you speak to a crazy person, they’ll likely go off on you. For safety, it’s likely I wouldn’t have approached you either (unless you were somehow making it clear that you were attacked, like crying). It’s terrifying and horrible what you went through, and it’s also terrifying to see someone bleeding who had been in some kind of altercation bc you worry if they’re going to attack you."

"Looking to live here? Don’t pick the Aston in Scottsdale An excerpt from a letter I have sent to the leasing office regarding my experience: (New management led me down this rabbit hole of issues) Aston Scottsdale 8688 e Raintree Dr. 85260 Scottsdale, AZ Dear Aston Scottsdale, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as your tenant to address some serious safety concerns that I have been experiencing in my rented apartment at 8688 e raintree drive. I have thoroughly reviewed our lease agreement, specifically the clause regarding cancellation due to safety concerns, and I believe that the issues I am facing warrant invoking this clause. According to Section 36 of our lease agreement, I have the right to terminate the lease with situations involving domestic violence, personal safety, or military deployment. I believe that the ongoing issues I mention in the next section impede on my personal safety- and I request that you consider this as formal notice of my intent to cancel renewal of the lease. My primary concerns are as follows: 1. Plumbing Issues with myself and Incidents with Other Tenants: I have been experiencing persistent plumbing issues in my apartment, which have not been adequately addressed despite my previous complaints. These issues have led to water leaks and disruptions, causing significant inconveniences and potential damage to my personal belongings. Additionally, there have been incidents involving other tenants in the building, creating an environment that I find unsettling and unsafe. 2. Mold and Internal Water Damage: I have observed signs of mold growth and softening of the walls in my apartment including the ceiling with black mold, which I suspect are consequences of internal water damage. Mold poses health risks, and the compromised structural integrity of the walls is a safety concern that I cannot ignore. 3. Repeated incidents of vandalism to my front door I have had coffee spilled on my front door by other residents as well as some substance spilled on my door mat that have cause me inconveniences and uncomfortability. 4. Insufficient maintenance Maintenance is unreliable and requests put through the leasing office take longer than acceptable time and more often than not you will not hear from them regarding the issues unless you escalate- Leaving me to only assume that my personal safety is the least of their concerns 5. Bad management The Management at this building ignores issues- are unprofessional in how they handle them and do not have any respect for tenants and their personal requests such as maintenance and internal apartment issues. They use a lot of gaslighting tactics as part of their initiative to sell, for maintenance, and lease issues.","I just moved out of there. New management is ridiculous. Connor group, private equity firm, jacked up everyone’s rent by 250-500 a month. And added tons of bullshit fees. Tried hard sales tactics to get me to re-sign, I basically laughed at them. The lobby is really nice. But the apartments are regular. Moved 25 minutes away, paying 600 less per month for a way nicer place. But they ain’t gonna let you out of a lease without cracking you. No chance."

"How are the people in Gilbert? I’ve been reading a lot about various cities across the US and Gilbert, AZ is on the top of my list! However one thing I keep seeing in reviews are critiques of the people of Gilbert. Specifically the complaints are about the Mormon community and how they’re a bit nosey and may even be rude to you. Note I’m not a kid so I’m not worried about school bullying. I’m mostly talking about being ostracized or even outright told to leave because I’m not a white Christian. So my question is will a non religious single Asian guy do well in a place like Gilbert or do you think it’ll be challenging? Please be honest and don’t worry about offending anyone. I really want the truth so I can make a good decision. In general I’m hoping Gilbert: - is safe - is affordable - has some nightlife (bars not clubs) - has single girls around my age Thank you in advance! Hopefully we get to hang out in the dessert!",Categorizing people based on their religion is much akin to racism. The Mormons are as diverse as any other group of individuals. Next time you feel like generalizing look in the mirror. Shame on you and I hope you move elsewhere.

"Setting boundaries around post-midnight activities with apartment owner Hi all, I am seeking advice with regards an extension of my current lease. I rent the top floor apartment of a two-family home in NYC and the owner lives on the first floor. The last few months I am experiencing a strange situation where, he returns from work at \~11PM and he starts doing activities in and around the house that generate noise after 12AM and often times at or after 1AM . These activities involve garbage disposal for next day's pickup, organizing cabinets in the kitchen etc. (the sound insulation in the building is non existent). All these noises interfere with my sleep. During the rest of the day and before leaving for work, he is relatively quiet. I've told him a couple of times to stop that behavior but, after a brief pause for a couple of days, he resumes the same pattern. My current lease is coming to end and I have verbally agreed to renew, but haven't signed a new lease. I am also past the date when I should have notified him if I were planning to vacate. The question is whether it is reasonable to negotiate with him a new lease rider that includes a list of activities that are not permissible after 12 AM when I go to bed. I understand there won't be an enforcement mechanism, but at least, it will give me some legal grounds to break the lease without facing legal consequences (even if I had to forfeit the security deposit). Thank you.","Since you live on the top floor, I imagine that your issue would be solved with playing white noise loud enough to block out the sounds of him doing these activities at night. You can play white noise from your laptop and/or from any sort of Google Home/Alexa without having to buy a specific white noise machine!"

Am I missing something, or is it very difficult to afford your own place with this income in NYC? What are your thoughts?",u can absolutely find a 2k or less studio in harlem. its hard but doable check street easy daily. also might be worth contacting bohemia realty they seem to do a lot of rentals in upper manhattan

Snails deposit eggs on leafy green plants . Eggs or larvae are then eaten by a mammalian host where it settles in the brain . The damage can be fatal .

"Things to know if you want to be a daycare teacher or put your kids in daycare. I cannot use real names for fear of being sued by the daycare. this is my first post. Ill answer any questions you have. I have a son of my own and I’ve grown to appreciate children in general a little bit more. Not only are they a sign of hope for the future, but they often make us realize a lot more about ourselves and our parents. The day care I worked for catered to infants all the way up to school age kids during summer break. So a wide arrange of kids. Its hard to put to words all the things I saw. I was shaking with anger the day I quit. I had been there a total of 4 months part-time as an assistant teacher. I’m going to go in chronological order so stay with me. The first week was fine. Kids didn’t want to nap or follow directions. Usual kid stuff. I was mostly a floater who at the time had only been working with ones and twos. By week 2 I was in pre-k. from what I understand a lot of schools will combine classes to save money on labor for teachers. In a business sense it works, in real life it doesn’t. So, the threes were moved into the pre-k class towards the end of the day and during snack a three-year-old girl trips and hurts her knee. A three-year-old boy ran and jumped at the opportunity to slap her in the face as hard as possible, and I mean jumped. when I yelled at him and said “that’s not ok.” He laughed. Now I know three-year-olds don’t have a lot of emotional intelligence, but that behavior is obviously learned. That same boy would constantly hit or bite other kids, mostly girls, but boys too; and no, none of them ever hit back. They feared him. There was also an incident where I can’t say for sure what happened. I only noticed when the same three-year old girl came up to me in nothing but her underwear. In horror I found her clothes in a little reading library with the same little boy’s clothes. He was also naked. You might ask why me, or another teacher didn’t notice it in the moment. Two teachers in a mixed class of 22 kids from three to school age is perfectly legal. I had only been there for 2 weeks no one mentioned anything about this shit to me. As far as I know the boy is still there. He was not the only one. Another boy in pre-k would do much scarier things. I had to pull the pre-k boy off of another pre-k girl during nap time not once but three times. He would lay on top of her while she was trying to sleep. She had told me the second time that he was threating to pull down her shorts. I was livid and trying to stay calm and moved him to the other side of the room so I could talk to the other teacher. As soon as I turn around, he is back on top of her. We sent him to the office for the rest of the day, but he was allowed to return. For over a week he was there until he wasn’t I don’t know why they finally decided to kick him out, but he was kicked out. He was just as violent as the three-year-old, but a lot bigger. Not long after this both me and my son started getting sick. Not covid sick though it could’ve happened. In one week, I had confirmed strep throat and I swear two different stomach bugs. The first bug was all diarrhea and the second was evacuation of all orifices. It was so bad I called 911 when I couldn’t stop evacuating for 6 hours straight. We would constantly get sick through out this time. No sick leave for this time either. While the whole staff including directors knew this was the right of passage yet no financial relief anywhere. The next week one of the infants caught covid and they shut the infant room down. I thought good that’s what they should do. Then I saw the siblings of those infants in their classes as usual. They expected us to get these kids to keep their masks on. The masks where left all over the pre-k class and the twos where not expected to wear them. Which would change when one of the twos tests positive they didn’t shut either class down and continued to combine them. Threes in pre-k and twos with the one-year old’s. You cannot get two-year-olds to wear masks for longer than 2 minutes. They were also left all over the class. Now my son was in the ones class, and I was already worried then my niece who was in pre-k caught covid and had to be hospitalized. Which is how I know they never notified other parents of the outbreak. They financially kept me coming back. I was already upset with everything I’ve seen so far. I had already started applying for other jobs. 50 cents above minimum wage and still paying 50% of my son’s tuition to be there. The lead teachers wouldn’t do their jobs. they wouldn’t update the tablet, to send info to parents, nor update the actual paperwork. when I asked the assistant director how to do anything on the tablet she didn’t know how. None of the information on each tablet was the same. Despite switching classes over to combine them. Some of the teachers would avoid giving the kids water during snack time to avoid changing more diapers. We were required to check diapers every hour. A lot of teachers either didn’t record it or didn’t do it and recorded as if they did. They cleaned the toys by spraying bleach water on them and letting them dry. No scrubbing or real deep cleaning. only one teacher out of 6 did everything she was supposed to do. Now for the time leading up to the day I quit. I had been in the ones room and I noticed a boy who wouldn’t sit during snack time. I thought it was odd and tried to help him sit down. He cried when his butt hit the chair. We examined his butt, nothing obvious to us no rash or anything. Then we noticed a big black spot on this boys lower back/butt. We called front office to look. Assistant director came in and told us he was born with it. (My son has what’s called a blue butt. It’s a mark from birth that looks like a bruise but isn’t and is known to run in families with Asian ancestry). So I know about this. I told her he can’t sit and she just brushed it off. I never had a chance to talk to his parents though I desperately wish I did. I couldn’t keep a close eye on the boy since I was constantly moving rooms to break teachers, but he seemed to be doing better. Able to sit anyway. A few weeks roll by and I am just past my 90 days. Worst that has happened during this time was my pto request denied. I wanted to take some classes one day a week and I couldn’t use my pto to fill it even though it worked perfectly for the time the classes were running about 8 weeks with one paid holiday. Without it I couldn’t afford to pay bills and attend classes at the community college. So, I was already ticked about it even after I explained it to assistant director. Whatever not the end of the world. Later that day I was in the ones class again. Just as they were putting the twos in, I noticed there where 16 kids total. Legally there can only be with two teachers together with 12 kids ages one and two. Not long after that the assistant director walks in and just as I was about to tell her there is too many kids, she noticed the boy with the butt bruise crying. No one can figure out why. In less than 2 minutes he becomes unresponsive. She called 911 and the parents. The fire truck pulled up in less than 5 minutes and the grandma and mom of the boy got there first. Denied him any treatment and left. As soon as they do the assistant teacher walks in the room to talk to us. Not about what we did or what was going to happen, but to say that she knew that boy’s dad was beating him. With a smile said that one of the kids must of hit him and that was all that was needed. to quote her “that was the last hit”. Why was she smiling? why didn’t she report the abuse and told us not to worry when we worried? I was already at my wits end and this was my final hit. I was not about to be wrapped up in a child abuse case or have my son be here. I wrote my statement and left. Next day I texted the director with all the things I witnessed and wrote, this is my two weeks. Use my pto because I will not be back. Its worth noting that most of the teachers there had been there less than 6 months and 3 had already quit before I did. I really hope that boy is ok.",You were a mandated reporter while being employed and were required BY LAW to report this. Regardless of who else knows and didn’t do anything. “I was not about to be wrapped up in a child abuse case” you should be reporting all of this - there is no excuse.

Chandler turf removal rebate...beware numerous catches I'm getting ready to have the grass removed from my backyard and remembered hearing that Chandler has a $2/sq ft rebate for doing this.

There is a [list of requirements](,"The canopy is measured based on its expected mature size, even though the tree/bush is tiny when you plant it.

It's hard pack, swept clean type ground similar to natural desert with zero weeds and little brick paths here and there but it would have to be gravel to qualify and I just don't want gravel out there. I can walk barefoot on the dirt. I also have a small pond that's been there for 30 years but a water feature immediately disqualifies you. I wish the program would have rewarded me for changing my huge grass front yard entirely to gravel but it won't because of the back yard."

"Why is dating in Scottsdale so difficult? I moved to Scottsdale just under a year ago. In most ways, I love it. I love the scenery, the ease of living, how clean/organized most things are, and the hiking and how much there is to do in general. But my biggest gripe is dating here seems incredibly hard. I know people say this about every city but that hasn't been my experience. I''ve lived in Vancouver, Montreal, Dublin, and Chicago and had a pretty good dating life in all them. Met lots of great people, and would never have an issue lining up a date when desired. In Scottsdale, it's been mostly horrible. Dating apps have been a dead end for me, while in most of the above cities I've been quite successful (I probably get \~1/5th the matches of any other city I've lived in). I've tried meeting people in person too, from going out in Old Town to chatting up people on hikes, and it's also been mostly a dead end. People do not seem receptive to conversation and almost seem shocked a stranger would chat with them. Even in settings (ie nightlife) where it's a fairly normal thing. When I have met people, on the majority of dates I have been on, my dates seem to put zero effort in and are borderline disrespectful - which again, is not my experience living elsewhere. I know it's easy to assume I'm the problem, but I'm a social person, in good shape, above average height, well educated (specialized master's) with a high paying job, live in a very nice place, blah blah. I thought maybe it's just a function of getting older, but went on a recent week-long trip to San Diego and had no trouble meeting people there. Does anyone else have this experience? Any advice? Where do 29 year old guys meet people here?","You're not crazy. I'm from northern Nevada and there are literally 4 million more people in a more dense area here, but I can't seem to meet people. It's not just women either. I'm bi so it's just people in general that don't seem open to anything."

"Native-owned businesses/services to support I’ll be visiting Sedona in early September and want to be sure to support some Native owned businesses in the area. It’s been challenging to find a good list. Food spots, alternative medicine services, a goods store, metaphysical shops? Would be appreciative of any suggestions! Edit: In researching Sedona as a travel destination I was majorly put off by how so many of the highly celebrated businesses are run by colonizers and appropriators. Given that demographic, I can’t say I’m surprised by some of the racism-tinged comments. Despite how brutally Natives have been, and continue to be treated, they still contribute beautifully and meaningfully to society, sharing pieces of their culture with others who care to learn.

I am a mother of a DD adult. He can’t drive. Works a job 2 hours a day and I have just signed a lease in his first apartment! I’m furious because he can’t drive and his main obstacle to independence is transportation. He rides an Electric bike and is limited to the distance of the bike can go a the battery and the load he can carry in a back pack. He can get to and from work - but what about the grocery store or the laundry mat. What of all the others out there like him - trying to be independent in 110 summer heat because there is not transportation options! I have looked into transportation- begged - called multiple resources- same thing- “no we don’t offer any of those service- no we don’t have transportation service - no we don’t assist with cost of transportation services- no we dont provide service to Apache junction” why can’t something be done to have rural metro dial a ride extend to AJ ? we have people with needs here! how can he and others like him work and pay taxes in a city and not be provided the service he needs - ADA has a law for everything - why not free or reduce transportation options if public transportation isn’t available ?? He is on disability and makes little money but would like to be able to go to the laundry mat to do his laundry and use the skills he has- promote independence is on every ISP ! But the limited services aren’t allowing for independence! So frustrated !

"Chelsea Piers vs Equinox vs Crunch Fitness - DTBK Interested in everyone’s experiences and thoughts regarding these three gyms in Downtown Brooklyn. Chelsea Piers seems to be the most spacious and has a ton of classes but if I leave the area, there aren’t very many throughout the city. Equinox seems really cramped and has fewer classes but has more locations city wide. Crunch I haven’t visited but it seems like it would be the most value for the $ but that might lead to it being packed at peak hours (maybe even more so than the other two more expensive gyms). Would love to join something closer to Clinton Hill but my options seems to be CKO or Cross fit.

"Avoid sobaya AT ALL COSTS Traveler from up north visiting nyc for the first time. Have been here a few days and have encountered zero issues regarding payment or tipping at restaurants. Visited Sobaya at 229 E 9th St for an early dinner. The restaurant wasn’t full; perhaps around five other tables when we entered. The usual ordering and food was all typical. Service was definitely below average with the employees ignoring us for water refills and there was an observable stark contrast in service. For example, the employee provided a very thorough explanation of drink options to the table next to us. While when speaking to my table, they had a short attitude as if they would rather be anywhere but there. When we received the bill, we noticed an item was not on it and even mentioned it to the waitress before paying. The problem arises after payment of bill and cash tip. A different waitress (not the same as the one that billed us) chased after us and stated that we did not tip enough. However, we have left a more than suitable and acceptable amount despite the horrible service provided. She spoke to us in an extremely derogatory manner as if I was dumb and did not understand tipping (note: tipping exists in Canada too). However in the heat of the moment, we handed over a couple more bills. During this interaction, she lectured us about how there was a law about how we had to tip them a certain percentage but none of us have ever heard of it. Despite our thorough research before visiting, we have not seen a single mention of this but became a bit unsure of whether there was such a thing. However she insisted that there was this tipping rule and even told us to google it if we wanted to in a very demanding and nasty tone. Even after we handed over the amount she wanted, she kept going on how this is how waiters survive here in a woe is me type of tone. Afterwards, we did extensive googling and have been unable to find anything about this “rule” and I personally feel very uncomfortable with this entire experience which is why I decided to share this in hopes that no one else received this kind of experience. I also came up with two potential reasons as to why this happened. 1) my table spoke some Mandarin from time to time 2) we were tourists If anyone does visit, I’d hope you have a lot of extra money to spend and enjoy bad service that you paid for. If you truly want to try it, avoid the waiter with shoulder-length hair who speaks with a Thai or Indonesian accent.",are you sure she worked at the restaurant?

"Anyone interested in local supper/brunch clubs? I noticed the only supper club we have in Phoenix requires going out to other places, but I was wondering if there was any interest in supper clubs hosted from home? I love to cook and would love to host dinner parties for up to 4-5 people for meals every month or so. They would be small-batch prep meals made fresh with enough flexibility to accommodate restrictions as it'll be a smaller group. All the ingredients used will be locally sourced, and I will have information about all producers and farmers' produce I used. I am not sure about how expensive it would be yet, but curious to know how much people would be willing to spend for a meal made entirely at home with high-quality ingredients over going to a restaurant. I think to start off a gratuity based off preparation and individual choice would be a great model to experiment with but not sure if it would be entirely too sustainable based off that as I'd still have to spend the right money on good quality ingredients without ripping off any local producers and farmers. Just curious, not sure if I can start it this year, but would love to do it next year! I have a lot of space in my living room which I can convert into a dining room and get a proper dining table with chairs. I love to talk about food in general, so would love to connect with more like-minded people.",Very interesting. Once you have some more ideas or momentum let me know.

I don’t understand what the purpose of a city inspector is if they don’t catch any big problems.

He literally cut one in half before asking me.

I could tell from my tracker that like all accomplished pacers, this guy was also targeting to cross the finish line about 15-30 seconds ahead of the target cut off and that is exactly what happened. Right before the finish line he slowed down, turned around and waved the pace pole to encourage laggards like me to hustle over - which is exactly what I did and was thrilled to meet my sub 1:30 goal for the first time ever with a few seconds to spare. Such an exhilarating experience, made special by guys like him. Thank you brother if you see this!",I also followed him. He is excellent. He told us he would finished at 1:29:30. His name is Sam!
Anyone know anything about Sidepony Express returning? Been considering moving to Bisbee sometime in the future for a while now and have visited a few times. I accidentally planned one of my various trips down there while Sidepony Express was happening. I loved it and started planning another trip with some friends around that same time the following year as a way to look at potential houses and enjoy the festivities with them. Then covid ruined any plans of traveling and forced back my plans of moving. I’d still like to take some friends down there for something like that but it’s been radio silence online from the organizers for like two years now. Any of y’all heard anything about Sidepony ever coming back?,"I know Anamieke (who ran it) had kids over the last few years, and also lots of the music groups really wanted to start getting paid and not just do it for free anymore (I met people who flew in even from like Montreal to perform on their own dime, but still a lot for even Phoenix people to come down especially given how much $$$ rentals are now), so between those things and the pandemic shutting so much down for a while... word around town has mostly been it probably isn't coming back, and if so not like before. IIRC it originally started out as a celebration for her birthday years ago and grew from there. Of course we all miss it a lot, but there are a lot of other things starting to happen around here again. There are more venues open now, as well (ones which weren't even around last Side Pony) so there are a lot more performances to be had but not necessarily in big festival form. Believe there is a van life festival coming up at the end of April, though. Not sure about the music to be had but there is always something! A lot more burlesque shows are happening down here, too. :)"

Im sure the driver of the stolen / crashed vehicle is getting a longer sentence . He was driving and chose to follow the black charger causing the crash killing his companions.

"Brooklyn man pleads guilty to manslaughter in rock attack killing Queens grandmother A Brooklyn man faces a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter for fatally striking a 62-year-old Asian-American grandmother in the head with a rock in last year in Queens, the borough’s DA said Thursday. Guiying Ma was sweeping the sidewalk outside her Jackson Heights home on 38th Ave. near 97th St. on the morning of Nov. 26, 2021, when Elisaul Perez, 33, ambushed her, a criminal complaint said. He smashed a large rock against the left side of her head, knocking her unconscious. Perez threw a second rock at her head while she lay on the ground bleeding. The Thanksgiving weekend attack left Ma in a medically induced coma, from which she briefly emerged two months later. Ultimately, the trauma was too much to overcome, and she died in Elmhurst Hospital Center on Feb. 22, 2022 from complications. Supreme Court Justice Michael Yavinsky indicated that he would sentence Perez on Jan. 10 to 20 years in prison, with five years’ post-release supervision, the Queens DA’s office said. =========================== The above is from [","Man give that nigga life, fucking weirdo !"
"Legal advice for traffic accidents? Traffic keeps getting worse, and accidents seem more common. A neighbor of mine was recently hit at an intersection and now has hospital bills piling up. For anyone who’s dealt with this locally, do lawyers actually help in these cases, especially when it comes to negotiating with insurance? Or is it better to just deal with insurance directly? Curious to hear some real experiences from people in the area.","Get a personal injury attorney. Insurance companies will try to lowball you. At least talk to a lawyer. Don't give the other driver's insurance company too much information. They will use it against you to try to lower their liability. Most personal injury attorneys work on a contingency basis, where they receive 30% of the award or settlement. Most cases do not go to trial, but are settled out of court or on the eve of trial once the attorneys find out the other side's case. Hospital bills should be taken care of by the no-fault insurance. The biggest amount paid in a lawsuit will be due to lost wages and pain and suffering."

I drove by the accident just as the police were showing up and just really wasn't expecting something like that.

"As overdose deaths climb in NYC, East Harlem residents say drug injection site is hurting their neighborhood As the death toll from opioids skyrockets in New York, the role of supervised drug injection centers in reducing fatalities has been a key focus of attention. The center on 126th St. in East Harlem opened in November 2021 as the nation’s first, along with another OnPoint NYC location in Washington Heights. In East Harlem, neighbors say it’s become a magnet for drug dealers and users that’s created more drug use, violence and trash on the streets. “It’s sad,” said Ashley Valle, a Harlem resident and mom of a 5- and 3-year old as she stopped on her way home. “It’s basically saying drugs are OK, just don’t overdose. ... I’m scared to come out with my kids sometimes, I don’t want them to see that.” Rafi Alammari has lived in New York City for the past 37 years. East Harlem isn’t what it used to be, he said. The opioid crisis has spilled further into the street in the past few years. “I can tell you, it’s not good to me. It’s too much crimes, too much problems. The whole area is in trouble,” said Alammari, 46, who works at a deli right next door to OnPoint. “It’s like walking zombies, all the time,” he said. At a day care across the street and a school just a couple of blocks away, parents pick their kids up and walk to the train, sometimes glancing uneasily at groups standing on the curb outside the center. “It is undeniable that it’s having a negative impact on our community,” said Xavier Santiago, chairman of Community Board 11. Santiago says the area around the center has deteriorated since the center’s opening. “Custodians are constantly bleaching and cleaning the sidewalk from human excrement, urination and vomit, and not to mention needles,” Santiago said, adding that he’s seen the area increasingly become a hotspot for dealers and users. Shawn Hill, a community activist and co-founder of The Greater Harlem Coalition, said the center acts as a magnet to users and dealers, damaging the neighborhood. - - - - - - The above is from",NYC wanted devilRats aka democrats so this is what you got and continue to get when you had Guliani it was nice out this isn't rocket science

"Noticed “different” tenants in my apartment building for the last couple months. Shelter or Gov assisted units in my “luxury” building? Hello, I am renting an apartment in Coney Island Brooklyn for $3000/month net rent. The building is a “luxury” building. One of these newer builds with amenities and stuff. It was all probably really nice when it opened but the management does a terrible job maintaining it. Events over the last 2 months have had me thinking something new might be going on. First someone got stabbed by their girlfriend who actually did not live in the building. Then I noticed more than once people hanging out in the lobby that don’t live there and were kicked out (did not go quietly). Tenants that seem to have been / are homeless. For example traveling in and out of the building in dirty unkept clothes carrying excessive belongings in clear plastic garbage bags or multiple Target bags. Or tenants that seem to always be sitting outside smoking on the steps no matter what time I go outside. Even late at night and there’s this one individual that is always yelling to themselves cursing. I do know they are tenants because I have seen them enter the building and go up the elevator. I’m not usually like this but I’m not getting the feeling these people are paying $3,000 per month to live here like myself. I just want to understand what is going on and what kind of program this is. I have my girlfriend who is pregnant here and she has stopped going outside at night alone without me at this point. Is there any way I can see if my building is on some type of program in NYC offering help to the less fortunate?","If I were to get a luxury apartment and based on my income for many luxury apartments, I would have to pay $3000/mth.

"Brunch Reservations for 15 People My fiancé and I are getting married in Sedona in November. We are looking to have a brunch for no more than 15 people, however, renting out an event space within a restaurant is proving to be a bit tricky. Most places we've inquired with have food and beverage minimums that we can't meet with our small party and the cost for renting the space is on the expensive side for that small amount of people. (We may not even have 15 people, it might be closer to 10). We aren't opposed to not having a private event space - does anyone have any experience with reserving tables for 15 people at any of the brunch places? Or recommendations for places that might willing to accommodate grouping tables together?

"Suspect in Bronx gas attendant shooting also shot Philadelphia parking officer, NYPD says A gunman wanted for shooting and critically injuring a Bronx gas station attendant may also be responsible for shooting a Philadelphia parking enforcement officer three days later, police said Friday. The brazen, caught-on-camera shooting in Philadelphia took place just before 4:00 p.m. on Nov. 25, on Frankford Avenue near Orthodox St. in that city’s Frankford neighborhood, said police. The gunman — clad in the same blue hoodie, ski mask and gray pants he wore during the Nov. 22 Bronx shooting — walked up to a uniformed, on-duty Philadelphia Parking Authority officer, pulled out a silver revolver, and shot the officer at point-blank range from behind, video shows. The Philadelphia officer was struck in the left ear and shoulder, police said. The suspect fled on foot, and the 37-year-old officer was rushed to Temple University hospital where he was in critical condition, cops said. The Bronx gas station attendant, identified as borough resident Zulfiqar Alvi, 59, remained in critical condition Friday with a bullet still lodged in his head, cops said. “If he recovers he’ll never be the same,” the victim’s nephew, Malik Saud, 21 said. Alvi underwent one surgery but remains in a coma. He worked at the same Sunoco gas station for 15 years, and was the sole breadwinner for his wife and seven children who live in Pakistan. “We don’t know what they’re going to do,” Saud said of the family, who Alvi had not seen since 2007. “He’s not a man to fight. He was quiet. He just worked and that’s it,” Saud said, adding that the suspect targeted Alvi but he had “no idea why.” An anonymous tipster called the NYPD’s tip line on Nov. 30 telling them the Philadelphia shooter also shot Alvi, cops said. Police further determined the possible connection based on the man’s similar characteristics, identical outfit and the similar manner of the shootings both captured on video. Philadelphia police issued a video comparing the two incidents. Police have warned New York City traffic agents to take extra precautions while on duty. The city of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Parking Authority have each offered $10,000 for information that leads to an arrest. Anyone with information regarding either shooting is asked to call NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). The above is from [","So he shot 2 people point blank in the head and they both lived , not even a good murderer."

"Why do people, included New Yorkers, tell me people are mean or rude in NYC when I don’t see it? I live in LA and the people from NYC, and the East Coast in general, are like night and day. I was surprised how kind and helpful everyone outside of California was. So, I arrived in NYC for a wedding and bought one of those 1-week subway/bus passes at the airport and had no problem using it until my friend asked me to meet her at Queens. I use google maps to direct me which buses to take and I arrive by the bus stop and look a little confused. Literally, not even 5 seconds pass by when a woman sitting maybe 10 - 15 ft away, maybe even more than 25 feet ft away because I remember she was kind of far, notices me and immediately asks me if I need help and what I’m looking for. She then points me to the bus stop right in front of her. After waiting a few minutes, I get on the bus and the pass doesn’t work for this particular bus and the bus driver says I can’t use cash or whatever and have to fill the card somewhere and I was like where?? I get off the bus, flustered, when suddenly a woman yells, “Sir!” and asks me to come back inside and says she’ll pay for my fare. This happened another time that week when I took another wrong bus. Another night, my friend and I went to a bar/club and people were so nice to me lol!! My friend and I were posing for a picture when suddenly some random guy put his head on my shoulder to get in the picture, then he started flirting with me so loud, he almost offended and started a fight with someone else nearby haha. Then these two attractive girls stopped me while I was passing by and said they loved my shorts and wanted a picture with me. While I was dancing, two more girls just started dancing with me and then a little later another girl with her friends started dancing with me and her friend said if I was interested, she’s down lol!! I was pretty shocked because in LA, especially at the club, i don’t think anyone even pays attention to me . Also, my tinder blew up. In LA, was probably getting a trickling of 1 to 2 matches a day; in NYC, it was non-stop, like 600 messages (I’m bi). I also probably made more close, genuine friends in NYC over the span of a week than a year in LA. I also don’t know if Angelenos are helpful, because no one has ever offered any help and I’ve been here for 15 years. People in LA are friendly-ish in social situations, but that’s because they usually need something, and want to exploit my social network. I remember there was this guy who was making himself out to be someone kind of wealthy entrepreneur, and we all believed it, until I googled him and found it was a sham. This same guy asked out this girl I posted a picture with on Facebook and I thought that was kind of shady. He was also going through my social media and trying to get to some wealthy connections. He’s probably like many of the people I encounter in LA. Then I remember the time I went to my friend’s music industry party with a girl and the minute we walked in, all these guys were all over her and asking her out and I was kind of offended they didn’t even ask if we were together or not. But anyway, a lot of them were telling her they’d give her a break in the industry if she slept with them or went out with them or something, I don’t know, which was pretty distasteful. Then the random people who would befriend me at a party and the next say, I see they added a ton of my friends on Facebook for networking purposes. Ugh, the list goes on. I was set to move to NYC last year in March, but alas, the pandemic came unexpectedly. Now, I’m stuck here in LA. Love you guys.",I live here they are all self centered assholes until you meet the random nice one

"Our optics program is unique As an incoming wildcat with an interest in optics, I was advised not to study optics as an undergraduate because they told me that the field was too narrow and should instead study other broad degrees such as electrical engineering. I want to talk about optics and interdisciplinary research at the University of Arizona, which I have spent a lot of time summarizing on the web. Because I am an undergraduate student, I can't say for sure what field I will choose in the future, and choosing to study artificial intelligence or quantum mechanics may be just a decision I made in the heat of the moment. I believe that UA is currently effectively promoting interdisciplinary research with optics as a core strength discipline. For example, the new Grand Challenges Research Building in the College of Optical Sciences promotes the integration of optical and biomedical engineering, astronomy, computer science, quantum information science, and mechanical or electrical engineering. These innovations may lead to the diversification of research topics in OSC or other research areas, includes the development of an interdisciplinary field such as robotic vision. Optics is an important pillar of UA, driving the development of other strong majors(such as astronomy), so I think it is still a good choice to study optics for my undergrad degree in UA if I want to explore diversified interests, because optics here has almost unmatched reputation and the top faculty from all kinds of fields in the US. For more about teaching quality, because of its small class size, it can get more attention from professors and participate in research opportunities even for undergrad students. Even if I got into an Ivy League program, this was still a very rare scientific opportunity. What do you think of my idea?","I just finished my freshmen year. I was admitted initially as an ECE student, did research in an ECE lab, but found the optics program more compelling so I switched recently, but that’s because I plan to go to grad school. If you want to go to grad school for optics, do it now in undergrad. An optics undergrad at UofA is highly valued when applying to grad schools, even top ranking ones like MIT. Optics also lets you explore other engineering disciplines. They have multiple “tracks”, which don’t ever appear on your transcripts but offer additional guidance. I’m on the electro-optics track which earns me an ECE minor. An ECE minor (and maybe an MSE course or two) would be good for quantum research if you choose to follow that path. Being an OSE major also lets you take physics classes through and taught by optics professors, instead of the god awful department of physics. (Seriously, it’s not even the professors the classes are just fundamentally organized poorly)."

"STAY AWAY FROM JUNE HOMES June Homes I ADVISE ANYBODY READING THIS TO AVOID JUNE HOMES AT ALL COSTS. A simple google search will reveal that my experience was typical of a tenant with June Homes. June homes should be avoided at all costs. It is a sham company filled with scammers who prey on people without prior knowledge. I do not have the words to describe how emphatically I will inform people to avoid June Homes at all costs. I will be telling every single person I know to do anything and everything to avoid June Homes. I had the most disappointing experience with June Homes. From the moment I moved in, the apartment was in a state of unacceptable filth. Adding to my frustration, they unlawfully retained my security deposit and violated New York law regarding required landlord inspection prior to the move out and they failed to provide a functioning air conditioner during my stay. To make matters worse, my roommate was left without a key to the apartment for several days. This combination of issues made for an atrocious and highly unsatisfactory stay. June Homes violated New York tenant law multiple times. Firstly, they failed to return my security deposit in a timely manner. New York law requires a return of the security deposit within 14 days. However, June Homes’ policy is that they can hold your security deposit for up to 15 business days. I reached out multiple times once the 14 days elapsed demanding that my security deposit be returned, but they refused. They informed me that the policy is 15 business days, not 14 days. I insisted that their policy violated New York law, but they ignored clear provisions in New York law. Also, New York tenant law requires the landlord to perform a walkthrough with the tenant in the week prior to the tenants move out of the apartment, in which the landlord inspects the unit and notifies the tenant of every repair for each damage that he expects to deduct from the tenant’s security deposit. This gives the tenant time to cure any defects in the unit before moving out. This is explicitly required by law. However, when I requested this inspection, June Homes adamantly refused. They told me that’s “not how we function” and that’s “not how the process works”. Even though that requirement is spelled out clearly in New York law, they refused to abide by it. However, they offered the walk through at 9am the morning of my check out. Given check out is at 10am, this would have left me no time to “cure” any defects that the Landlord would have identified. Both of these experiences evidence the way that June Homes considers itself above the law of New York, as it insisted to stick to its policies regardless that they violate New York law. June Homes is not only clearly violating New York tenancy law, but is completely oblivious to the requirements imposed. Secondly, you can expect June Homes to violate the contract it signs with you. The contract stipulated that if an existing tenant occupying a room in an apartment wishes to refuse a new replacement tenant to another room in the apartment, then the current tenant has 24 hours to notify of their refusal of the incoming tenant. I had a friend who was trying to move in to the room in which a new tenant was moving in to, but her application was delayed. Once June Homes informed me that there would be a replacement tenant in the room which I was anticipating my friend to lease, I notified June Homes of my intention to reject the replacement tenant. I was within the 24 hour window and referenced the contract provision that permitted this. June Homes refused, aggressively. They told me that they could not accommodate my request and informed me the incoming tenant “has to move in today”. I informed them that refusing my request to deny the replacement tenant violated the signed contract we had. They finally acquiesced. This shows the disregard with which June Homes has towards its own agreements, and its willingness to violate a signed contract. Thirdly, the apartment was beyond disgusting when I moved in. June Homes does not care about the cleanliness and safety of their apartments. There was expired food in the fridge which included a molding onion, rotting cheese, expired eggs and yogurt, water filters with goop hanging out of them and even tea that expired in 2019. The fact that there was tea which had expired in 2019 proves the disregard with which June Homes conducts its cleaning and house keeping. The shower lining in the bathroom was moldy and yellow. There was even a used douchebag in one of the drawers, along with over a dozen empty shampoo and body wash bottles in the shower. The common spaces were filthy, evidencing the treatment June homes provide both its apartments and tenants with. The common space cabinets were also broken, as many of the cabinets did not shut fully or had missing/broken hinges. Further, there were several items left from the previous tenant in my room underneath my bed, including hangers, socks, and a paper bag. Because the lease required me to leave the premises in the exact condition in which I found it, I did not touch anything in my room. Upon moving out, however, June homes tried to retain money from my security deposit. They claimed that removing the hangers and paper bag underneath the bed (which had been left from a previous tenant) caused “damage” to the apartment, which I was accountable for. Upon pushing them to explain what the “damage” was from the leftover hangers, they tried saying that the “damage” was actually in reference to stains they found on the mattress topper. Regardless of the fact that the stains were clearly present in the move in report that I submitted, June Homes accused me of creating the stains on the mattress topper. They deducted an exorbitant amount of money for these “damages”. To prove that I was the cause of the stains, they sent pictures of the mattress topper left by the previous tenant. There was just one problem: June homes sent me pictures of an apartment that I didn’t even rent. They used pictures from an entirely different apartment to try to hold me accountable for the preexisting stains on the mattress topper in my room. It was only once I called them out on this when they acquiesced with my request to return my security deposit in full. Had I not put up a fight, June Homes would have stolen a significant portion of my security deposit from me. Fourthly, my roommate was not furnished with a key for days once she moved in. Because June Homes refused to immediately furnish her with a key, I had to rearrange my entire schedule to ensure she was able to access the apartment when she needed to. Regardless of the fact that June Homes told us they would provide her a key, they failed to do so for many days on end. This again shows the disrespect with which June Homes treats its residents. Further, there was a day when our keys wouldn’t even open the door because the door handle was completely disfunctional. Even though we notified June Homes of the issue we had been having with the door handle in the days prior, it wasn’t until we literally could not access our apartment that June Homes took action. They sent someone to assist, but it took over an hour for him to arrive and over an hour for him to fix the door. My roommate had to cancel her evening plans she had for her mother’s birthday and I was late to an event at work because of June Homes’ negligence. June Homes refused to act promptly in fixing the issue and compensating for the harm their actions caused. Fifthly, I also had issues with June Home regarding my air conditioning. All of the advertisements for my apartment online included personal air conditioning in the apartment room that I rented. It even listed “Personal Air Conditioning” in the advertisement. During my stay, the air conditioning quit functioning and my room would not cool. I informed June Homes that my AC was dysfunctional, and they told me they are not responsible for fixing. June Homes insisted that it was not a listed amenity in the lease, and so they are not responsible for fixing it. They even tried to tell me that the unit had been installed by a previous tenant. Given that the AC unit was built into the wall, and identical to every other unit in the apartment, it was likely that June Homes was being dishonest. Regardless, they refused to fix my AC in the middle of a heat wave during the thick of New York summer. June Homes does not value its residents, and reneges on their promises to tenants. Lastly, there was an instance which June Homes was providing my personal information to strangers. A previous tenant of the apartment had accidentally shipped a package to the June Homes apartment. Since I was a resident there, June Homes contacted me, imploring me to assist in delivering the package to the previous tenant. I informed them that was not my responsibility, but instead the responsibility of the landlord. June Homes then notified me that they would be giving my phone number to the previous tenant, a stranger, for them to contact me to retrieve my package. I contacted June immediately, demanding that they keep my personal information private. At first, June Homes refused to keep my personal information private because they wanted to give my phone number to a stranger. However, they finally acquiesced after I insisted to not share my phone number. It should not take a fight to keep someone’s personal information private.",I have really bad experience with that company too. They tried to avoid their responsibilities and did not solve the issues for customers.

"Have I grouped these correctly? Hi all, Visiting Sedona 28th – 30th Dec. (Saturday get there hopefully 11am or so, full day Sunday, about ¾-ish day on Monday before returning to Scottsdale). I want to do quite a few hikes (avid hiker here in Alberta), but really looking for some stellar views for some photography. Have I grouped these correctly? Saturday: -Was thinking Sugarloaf Loop as I will be getting to Sedona around 11am or so and it’s not one of the “off the charts popular hikes” so parking might be easier as I’m not starting first thing. Not sure what else I should tack on after. Sunday: -Cathedral Rock for sunrise. I know that is a shuttle day so where is the best place to park as I will needing to go earlier than the shuttle? -Bell Rock (would I now go park somewhere and get a shuttle at that point of the morning?) edit: the shuttle doesn’t seem to stop here -Chapel of the Holy Cross for a look-see -Views of Cathedral Rock for sunset (Cathedral Rock View (saw it on google) or Secret Slick Rock?) Monday: -Devil’s Bridge (yes I know, touristy! And I plan on getting up beyond early for this one). Is Mescal Trailhead parking lot on Long Canyon Road the place to park? That’s not necessarily a sunrise hike, just want to see it hopefully without 500 other people ;) -Doe Mountail Trail -Fay Canyon Trail Airport Mesa was so-so for me for sunset from pics I have seen. Also plan on doing some astrophotography. I’ll sleep when I return home Or if you think there is a better way to see these things please give me your 2 cents. I chose Devil’s Bridge on the Monday as it might be less busy, but I could swap Sunday/Monday around (minus sunset activities) if that makes more sense as it seems Doe/Fay don’t need a shuttle so maybe better to do on the Sunday. Just would need to figure out how to do Devil’s Bridge on the Sunday before the shuttle hours. I think I’m losing my mind!

"City parking So I may sound like a Karen, but it’s gotten really annoying. My neighbors in an apartment community have two commercial trucks for landscaping. They have their trailers and their huge trucks, which can take up two spots, which they were doing. Now they are parking in between the spots, where their front half of their truck is in one spot, the other half in another and spacing their trailers to fit one spot. This is now taking up 6 spots to even 7 if you don’t mind parking too close to the trailer that is just on the line. They block parking g spots with cones and have asked me to move my vehicle so they can get to their trailers more easily. Not a big deal whatever, but then they just leave their trucks there all day. I’m in the middle of getting a toddler ready for daycare and going to work, they just stay home? Who can I complain to, if this is city parking. These 8 spots are the only ones near my unit, without having to walk all the way around my building. I’m always carrying things like groceries Amazon packages my work stuff or my toddler, so it’s just easier to walk through my back patio.","If the parking spot is on a city street, you can call the non emergency police line and they’ll send an officer out. If the spots are on private property, then it would be up to property management to call a tow truck."

"Subsonic/bass shaking me awake from my insides this weekend? Posted in Sunnyside and Jackson heights since the groups are larger but I am actually in Woodside so figure let’s keep the conversation going. Disclaimer: I’m a young adult, used to socializing/ clubbing/ dancing. Have lived in Woodside for 3 years now and actually love that the city wakes up in spring and nights go longer. If you have ever done illicit part drugs and gone dancing, and returned home to go to bed….but that music bass is on a loop in your head and heart while you come down…. THATS what it felt like. But I’m pregnant and sober and it’s not that much fun in this scenario. BUT whatever this sound is is soooo frustrating to listen to! It’s not exactly LOUD because it’s just bass but it BOOMS your soul. It’s impossible to tune out because it’s guttural. Extremely low decibels blaring from around 10:30pm until approximately 3:30am as far as my being jarred & kept awake is aware of. Closing all windows, & Noise cancelling headphones don’t work to turn it out since it’s a low decibel. feels like a BPM that dips in and out of audibility every few seconds… not 100% clearly music though. Friday night I noticed it starting around 9:30/10 I think and went on until I fell asleep around 12:30/1am. I chocked it up to spring having sprung and a party going on. Didn’t care. It’s the weekend officially. Saturday I don’t think I noticed it because of the rainstorm. Can’t be sure if it happened or not. Sunday I fell asleep early on the couch around 9pm and was jarred awake at 11:30pm by the noise. After 2 hours of it’s consistently and sometimes more noticeable sounds I woke up my husband crying (I’m pregnant so a little exhausted with emotions) We drove trying to locate it. It was audible from 48ish to 67ish along queens boulevard and Roosevelt Ave but not distinctly louder or quieter on either end. The other Reddit threads have a few folks who recognized the experience. My next door neighbor confirmed it woke them up too… If it’s a business I just want to see if the bass BLASTING is necessary? I and most of NYC have work today on a Monday and look like a damn racoon from these sleepless bags. Anyone notice this? It must be even more annoying for someone else who’s closer to the source.","That's our wonderful mosaic. Call 311 if you know exactly where it's coming from. Otherwise, that's city life."

New to town… is Gilbert as conservative as it gets or is there a pocket of liberals I haven’t found yet? I’m just trying to get a pulse on the local political climate/values. Thanks so much!,"I live in a neighborhood near the Riparian Park.. Out of the 34 homes here (acreage), there are only 3 lib families, including mine. They actively trolled me and my next-door neighbor, even ran over my lawn sign (2020 election), which was 15' inside my yard. They pointed their signs toward our yards, and flew over-the-top flags next to our properties. They were pretty salty after the election, and my other immediate neighbor displayed a HUGE ""Trump Won"" flag over the front of their house. I responded with a large, yellow ""smiley face"" flag in my front yard (yes, I can be petty). That said, I think the leadership in the community is fairly progressive in their policies: good parks, school's, and roads. Downtown Gilbert feels safe, and I actively ask POC if they feel safe here. They all respond affirmatively. My POC friends (not token acquaintences) feel safe here as well. As a Lib with good people instincts, I feel Gilbert changing; from a tiny cowboy town when I was a kid, to the affluent, progressive place it's becoming. It's a good place to live. By the way, I agree with another person who posted thar after a couple minutes talking with someone, you'll quickly size them up politically, then out yourself. Happens all the time here."

"Had a crime free day yesterday  Yesterday, I walked around Williamsburg before the rain. I went from the Metropolitan Lorimer stop and took one last stop at Crest Hardware. Then I walked my way to Northside Bakery to get some bread from the neighborhood joint. I walked by a lot of people and some even said hi, some of those people were even darker colored people. After I got some bread, I was feeling like tacos and wanted to give Esse taco a try since it's been so hyped. I walked along Bedford and there were so many people about. Luckily there was some grass, I touched it and walked along bravely. I got to Esse and rewarded myself for my bravery, i even had to talk to a Hispanic man behind the counter to get some tacos. The tacos were mid, the store was really loud and busy. People kept walking in and out but I kept my eyes sharp to look out for danger. After tacos I started walking home and it was raining. I got caught and hid out under scaffolding for ten minutes. The scaffolding hid the sun and it was darker than the surrounding area, nevermind it was 4PM. Still darker and scary. But again, I held my ground in this warzone. Someone came up to me to hide from the rain too, and he started talking to me. I kept my hands around my keys in case of sudden movement.

"Handshake Reality Check Anybody else have dogshit Handshake experiences? Tbf, I did use it to get an on-campus job, and once upon a time I would look at real, career jobs and internships on occasion. But, at least in my field (education), it's an absolute garbage pile. I like getting messages from recruiters because I can warn my friends of those positions--I literally think my inbox is where sketchy internship and job offers go automatically. I get lots of messages from MLMs (eg Cutco/Vector), private schools that pay a 30k salary with either no background or a background with lots of employee and student abuse, finance sector unpaid internships, and Teach for America. In terms of actual jobs, I don't really know. For hourly positions outside of NAU, it's constant hit or miss. The actual layout of Handshake is enough of a pain that I'd rather just use, like, anything else. Education jobs posted on Handshake are, again, typically sketchy and/or underpaid. I sort of assumed it was better for other industries, but like, is it????? Has anybody landed a career w/ Handshake? Or an internship they liked? Or is Handshake not what NAU portrays it as? Does it shine best with on-campus work and internships?

"Abnormally loud boom from roughly north/northeast of McKellips and Lindsay. At exactly 9:27pm (21:27) tonight (11/4/2023), I was sitting in my living room and there was a very large boom that seemed to come from the north, maybe northeast.

"Thoughts on the Information Science Program? (B.S. Data Science Emphasis) Hello everyone! I am changing my major next semester and am considering the Information Science department. I love the Natural Language processing course I have taken so far and am planning to take CSC/LING/ISTA 439 in the Spring alongside some other programming courses. What are the major differences between them and similar majors such as Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, or the Statistics and Data Science majors? For those currently/past enrolled in the department, what are your thoughts?","I chose I.S. because i can choose SO much of my curriculum. I don’t need to take ugly courses with bad profs. I’m taking CSC 585 and ECE 540 as I.S. electives! The only downside (literally) is that you don’t get the CS B.S on your resume. The pipeline to the I.S. AMP is amazing and relatively easy if you excel in the I.S. BS, which isn’t hard to do relative to CS. The iSchool has this going for it. If you do IS, work to challenge yourself. It’s easy to slack off. Take discrete mathematics so profs will give you permission to take advanced courses like INFO 550, 521, 520, etc. Math is important for anything technical, including NLP. Do calc 1,2,3 and linear algebra at a minimum—seriously. Keep an eye on the CSC classes; consider a CSC minor so you can take advanced theory electives, which are always better in the CS dept. I’m eyeing CSC 588 rn and the prof gave me permission to take it if I want. The possibilities with IS are basically endless. Final note: if you have lots of high school transfer credit and want to do a PhD (lots of students fit this bill) do I.S. with a CS minor, 100%. This is my situation and I don’t think there’s a better option. IS major for the flexibility to do what I want, if you lock in you can basically graduate in 3 years OR choose to do an amazing honors thesis in whatever the f*** you want (you need to be REALLY exceptional to do both—I’m not), and CS minor for access to good CS theory courses if that’s important to you (if you want to do NLP, it should be!)"

"About to lose my freaking mind over unreliable Cox internet! Who are you using and what are your experiences? Are there even alternative solutions or are the other options just as lame? Work from home. For years I’ve never had any issues other than an occasional simple problem, which was resolved in a reasonable amount of time. In the past I have had high demands on the system by kids who were serious gamers, lots of streaming, all day Zoom webinars, constant downloads/uploads of content, 6 smart phones, multiple devices like 5 TVs, Alexa devices, a camera monitor and more. Never a bad experience. I have the fastest speed available because top level internet connection was necessary since I work from home. Until 3 months ago - when the connection stopped being reliable. Replaced 4 brand new well located modems, 4 service visits by a tech who seems to know his stuff, replaced wiring and all the other old components and we still can’t go a full day without it dropping. I’ve tried being patient and tolerated the situation while the frustrated tech tried solution after solution.
